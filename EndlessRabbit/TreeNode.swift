//  The TreeNode class represents a tree obstacle in the game. It is an SCNNode subclass that loads and sets up the tree model from the "Tree.scn" scene file.

=======
//  The tree model is loaded from the "art.scnassets/Tree.scn" file and added as child nodes to the TreeNode. The shadows of the child nodes are disabled to optimize performance.

//  The TreeNode is set up with a static physics body using a bounding box shape. The physics body is assigned a specific category bit mask to identify it as a tree obstacle during collision detection.

//  If the "Tree.scn" file is not found or fails to load, an error message is printed to the console.
